Similar to a line graph, area graphs use dots connected by a line. However, an area graph involves coloring between the line and the horizontal axis. You can use several lines and colors between each one to show how multiple quantities add up to a whole. For example, a retailer might use this method to display the profits of different stores over the same timeframe.\n"
